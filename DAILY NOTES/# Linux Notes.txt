# Linux Notes

Linux is an open-source operating system.

It consists of three parts: Kernel, Shell and Programs.

It is Hierarchical file system based

it is a multiprocess system based on unix

VI Editor

Editing files using the screen-oriented text editor **vi** is one of the best ways.

**Command mode** − This mode enables you to perform administrative tasks such as saving the files, executing the commands

**Insert mode** − This mode enables to insert text into the file.

vi always starts in the **command mode**.

vi filename, Shift key + I to type

The command to quit out of vi is **:q**. The command to save the contents of the editor is **:w**. You can combine the above command with the quit command, or use **:wq** and return.

chmod new.sh ./new.sh

then ctrl + o is to save, ctrl + x is to exit

Nano Editor:-

Create: nano filename

To save the changes you’ve made to the file, press `Ctrl+o`. If the file doesn’t already exist, it will be created once you save it.

To exit nano press `Ctrl+x`.

keep user in sudo group → sudo usermod -aG sudo username

Su  is used to  command to change user 

adduser / useradd  for adding user.

$0 refers to the whole input that is passed.

In a shell script, **`$1`** and **`$2`** are special variables called positional parameters. They represent the command-line arguments passed to the script when it is executed.

if [ "$num" \< 0 ] also works for below

```bash
if [ "$num" -ge 0 ]; then
echo "The number is greater than or equal to 0."
else
echo "The number is less than 0."
```

-ge means greater than equal to

-gt means greater than

-lt means less than

Kernel

The Linux kernel is the main component of a [Linux operating system (OS)](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

1. **Memory management:** Keep track of how much memory is used to store what, and where
2. **Process management:** Determine which processes can use the central processing unit (CPU), when, and for how long
3. **Device drivers:** Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes
4. **System calls and security:** Receive requests for service from the processes

GREP ->

The grep filter finds a file for a specific character pattern and shows every line that includes that pattern.

1. $ sudo apt-get install grep

grep -i “hello” text.txt  → -i for uppercase or lowercase

The grep -r command is used to search for a specific pattern recursively in files and directories. The -r option stands for "recursive" and allows grep to search for the pattern in all files and subdirectories within the specified directory

• **grep -vM**: The 'grep -v' command displays lines not matching to the specified word.

• `-w`: Find the exact matching word from the input file or string.

• `-c`: Count the number of occurrences of the provided pattern.

The `ps aux` command is a tool to monitor processes running on your Linux system.

cp $source_file $destination_file ( cp /path/to/source/file.txt /path/to/destination/file.txt)

cp command

This command will copy the file named **`file.txt`** from the **`/path/to/source`** directory to the **`/path/to/destination`** directory.If the destination file already exists, it will be overwritten with the contents of the source file.

**`curl`** is a versatile command-line tool that supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and more. 

SED→

“sed” command in Linux stands for stream editor and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.

**`$sed 's/good/great/' hello.txt`**

Here the “s” specifies the substitution operation. The “/” are delimiters. The “good” is the search pattern and the “great” is the replacement string.

The /g specifies sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.

/1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line.

****Use the combination of /1, /2 etc and /g to replace all the patterns from the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line.

**`sed 's/unix/linux/3g' file.txt`**

This sed example prints the first character of every word in parenthesis. **`$ echo "Hello World" | sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\(\1\)/g'`**

The **`a`** command in **`sed`** is used for appending text after a line. Let's append a new line after the second line “sed '2a\This is the appended line.' example.txt”.

Parenthesize first character of each word: **`sed '3 s/hello/world/' file.txt`**

the **`mount`** command is used to attach a filesystem ( hard disk partition or a remote network share) to a specific directory in the file system hierarchy.

```bash
mount [options] <device> <mount_point>
```

```bash
man uname
man printf
```

man:  Manual pages provide detailed documentation, explanations, and examples for the specified commands, helping users understand their usage and options.

The **`fsck`** command is used in Linux and Unix-like operating systems to check and repair filesystem inconsistencies.

PGREP→

the **pgrep** command searches for [processes](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/process.htm) currently running on the system, based on a complete or partial process name, or other specified attributes and retrieve their process IDs (PIDs).the **-f** option, **pgrep -f "name"** allows you to search for processes that match a specific pattern in their command line arguments.

```bash
 pgrep -f "pattern"
```

Searching for processes- run **`pgrep -f "name"`**

The command **returns the PIDs of the processes** that match the pattern. Each PID is printed on a separate line.

kill pid → To Kill the Proccess.

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

"ps aux" command, which lists all running processes,"grep" command to filter the output and display only the lines that contain the keyword "nginx". The result will show you the processes related to "nginx".

```bash
sudo less /etc/shadow 
```

The **`less`** command is a pager utility in Linux.It allows you to view the contents of a file in a scrollable manner, making it easier to read and navigate through large files or output that doesn't fit in a single screen.

SSH Commands:-

ifconfig: shows ip and mac addresses

ping [domain_name]

`host [domain_name_or_ip]`

dig [domain_name]

nslookup [domain_name_or_ip]

sudo apt update

1. Install the OpenSSH server package:

```

sudo apt install openssh-server

```

sudo systemctl start ssh

sudo systemctl status ssh

The **`chown`** command is used in Linux to change the ownership of files and directories. It allows you to modify the user and group ownership of one or more files or directories.

ss - The **`ss`** command in Linux is used to display detailed information about network sockets, network connections, and network statistics

```bash
ss-t # to display tcp packets connectionn
ss-u # udp
```

ssh: remote access to hosted machine - its encrypted and secure

```bash
ssh username@hostname 
ssh username@hostname -p port_number

```

- The **`ssh-keygen`** command is used to generate SSH key pairs, which consist of a public key and a corresponding private key.
- Hard links and Soft Links:-
- Hard links are direct links to the underlying data of a file or directory. They share the same data and cannot link across different file systems.
- Symbolic (soft) links are special files that act as pointers to another file or directory. They can span across different file systems and have their own permissions and ownership.

The **`ln`** command in Linux is used to create links or symbolic links between files or directories. It is primarily used to create shortcuts or references to other files or directories

```bash
ln file file-hard-copy
ln -s file file-soft-copy ( this creates shorcut)
```

CentOS➖

It is a command-line package management utility used in Red Hat-based Linux distributions such as CentOS.Some of the Commands:-

`yum install package1.rpm -y`

`yum localinstall package1.rpm`

`yum update package1.rpm`

`yum update –y`

`yum grouplist`

`yum version available`

`yum version group`

`yum history`
