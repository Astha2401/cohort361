Web application development in Python using Flask

Web application development in Python using Flask involves using the Flask framework, which is a lightweight and flexible framework for building web applications. Flask allows developers to create web applications quickly and efficiently by providing a set of tools and libraries for handling HTTP requests, routing, and rendering HTML templates.

To illustrate an example of web application development using Flask, let's consider a simple task management application. First, we would start by installing Flask using a package manager like pip. Once Flask is installed, we can create a new Python file, let's call it "app.py," and import the necessary modules:
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)


Next, we can define routes and associated functions to handle different URLs. For example, we can define a route for the home page ("/") and a route to display a list of tasks ("/tasks"):
@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Task Management App"

@app.route("/tasks")
def tasks():
    task_list = ["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3"]
    return render_template("tasks.html", tasks=task_list)


In the above code, the home() function returns a simple welcome message for the home page, and the tasks() function renders an HTML template called "tasks.html" and passes a list of tasks to it.

We can create the "tasks.html" template file in a templates folder and define the HTML structure and dynamic content using Jinja templating:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Task Management</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Task List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for task in tasks %}
        <li>{{ task }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

In this template, we use the Jinja templating syntax to loop through the tasks and display them as list items.

Finally, we can add a conditional check at the bottom of the "app.py" file to ensure that the application is run only if the file is executed directly:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
This allows us to run the Flask development server and access our web application on a local host.

Overall, web application development in Python using Flask involves defining routes, handling requests, and rendering HTML templates. Flask provides a straightforward and flexible framework for building web applications, making it a popular choice among Python developers.
